    <p>An interactive map to find opportunity for education, employment, fiscal capacity, income, and transportation for any place in Chicagoland.</p>

    <h3 id='using-the-map'>Using the map</h3>

    <p>You can find the opportunity index for any area in the Chicagoland region by browsing and clicking on the map, or by entering an address and clicking the search button. The map is colored in shades of green - the darker the color, the higher the opportunity.</p>

    <p><img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='images/screenshot-oak-park.png' alt='Wheres the opportunity?' title='Wheres the opportunity?' /></p>

    <p>When an area, which is made up of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract'>US Cencus Tracts</a>, is highlighted, you'll see the opportunity index on a scale of 1 to 5, and five of the underlying opportunity indicators:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Home value:</strong> median market value of homes in 2010</li>
      <li><strong>Above poverty:</strong> percent of residents above the poverty line</li>
      <li><strong>Job travel time:</strong> average time spent commuting to work. Includes time spent driving, walking or taking public transportation</li>
      <li><strong>Employment rate:</strong> percent of residents over 18 who are employed</li>
      <li><strong>Education rate:</strong> percent of residents with educational degrees. Includes highschool, bachelor’s degree, and graduate degree</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id='background'>Why did you make this?</h3>

    <p>In November of 2013, the <a href='http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/'>Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning</a> published the Chicago region’s first <a href='Chicago Region FHEA November 2013.pdf'>Fair Housing and Equity Assessment</a>.</p> 

    <p>This document, which was created in partnership with the Chicago Area Fair Housing Alliance, analyzes impediments to fair housing at the regional level and makes recommendations for affirmatively furthering fair housing.</p>
    
    <p>The report highlights disparities in access to opportunity and provides a data-driven mapping of the opportunity-rich areas in the Chicago region. From this report and the mapping exercise, the idea to launch an interactive, user-friendly map was conceptualized.</p>

    <p>The interactive opportunity map is a tool for housing counselors interested in providing search services for housing seekers making "opportunity moves."</p>

    <hr>
    <h3 id='whos-it-for'>Who's it for?</h3>
    <p>With this tool, counselors can type in an address and access opportunity indicators for that particular census tract. Equipped with this information, counselors can provide more holistic information and housing seekers can make informed decisions regarding where they would like to live and what community factors are most important to them.</p>

    <p>Where you live matters and CAFHA envisions a region where access to opportunity is equalized and concentrations of poverty are diminished.</p>

    <h3 id='opportunity-index'>What's an opporunity index?</h3>

    <p>An index is a way to summarize and weight attributes about something. This opportunity index attempts to measure the quality of life opportunities available to people living throughout Chicagoland.</p>

    <p>The underlying opportunity indicators were categorized under: education, employment, fiscal capacity, income, and transportation- -- together forming an opportunity index.</p> 

    <p>Data sets for the opportunity index were divided into quintiles and averaged to determine an opportunity score for each census tract in the region. Fiscal capacity is measured at the municipal level and includes relevant local taxing bodies.

    <p>Opportunity is mapped using ten factors:

    <table class='table'>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Opportunity</th>
          <th>HUD Factors</th>
          <th>Additional Factors</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Housing</td>
          <td>Housing Stability Index</td>
          <td>Median Home Value</td>
        </tr>

    <p>The U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) generated indices explained:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Housing Stability Index:</strong> includes the homeownership rate, percent of low-cost refinanced loans, percent of low-cost new purchase loans, percent of crowding, and percent of vacancies.</li>
      <li><strong>School Proficiency Index:</strong> includes school math and reading proficiency compared to the state’s math and reading proficiency.</li> 
      <li><strong>Job Access Index:</strong> the tract-level job counts, tract-level job worker count, origin-destination flows, aggregate commute time, and average commute time by mode.</li>
      <li><strong>Transit Access Index:</strong> the census tract distance to a fixed rail.</li>
    </ul>
